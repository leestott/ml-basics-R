Common plot types for visualizing numeric data distributions are *histograms* and *box plots*, so let's get our [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) on and create one of each of these for the **rentals** column. [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) extends `ggplot` API by providing mathematical operators (such as `+` or `/`) for combining multiple plots. Yes, as easy as that! 📈📉\n",
        "\n",
        "> *In case you are new to R, R has several systems for making graphs, but `ggplot2` is one of the most elegant and most versatile.

        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "#### Encoding categorical variables\r\n",
